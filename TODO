0/ Convert everything to C++11


1a/ Add correct acceptance criterion to MCPMC
1b/ Get MCPMC to run for a simple (scalar) Gaussian

2/ Make it run for a 2-dimensional Gaussian
3/ Make it run for a 2-dimensional sum of Gaussians


4/ Create data and visualizations:
     - convergence histories for mean value/stddev for 
         50 runs with MH
     - same for MCPMC
   both as function of #samples taken overall

5/ Implement in parallel (threads)

6/ Write up general algorithm and results for 2/3 above



7/ Do all of this for the elliptic parameter estimation problem
